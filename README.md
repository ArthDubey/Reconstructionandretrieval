# Reconstruction and retrieval
An highly efficient software build for designers to reconstruct 3D mesh from an unlabelled, unordered set of images. It also has an additional feature of retrieving 3D meshes from online databases.

# Aim

To build a software which provides an extremely convenient way for designers to recreate or retrieve 3D models as per their wish.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository in your system and follow these steps-
1. Check if the requirements are satisfied.

2. Download the weights from the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f8_6yUAyuJlprSqE8yPGdAi9acN6Rod2/view?usp=sharing and copy them in output/ResidualGRUNet/Defaultmodel. The recreation module is an extensive network of 3D CNN followed by flattening and 2D CNN trained on ShapeNet database. As this a heavy network it is advised to download the pre-trained modelâ€™s weights.

3. Run the program interwin.py.

4. Enjoy your results.


### Requirements

1.SciPy 

2.Numpy 

3.Imageio 

4.Open-cv

5.Tensorflow

6.Theano>=0.8

7.EasyDict

8.Pillow

9.pyyaml

10.sklearn


Note- Most of these can be easily installed via pip

```
pip install scipy
